# 🎓 Student Dropout Prediction App

A **Streamlit** web application that predicts whether a student will **Dropout**, **Graduate**, or remain **Enrolled** based on their academic and demographic features. This project utilizes a **Random Forest Classifier** for prediction and provides an interactive interface for users to test predictions by adjusting input features.

---

## 🔗 Project Demo

You can run this app locally using Streamlit or deploy it on platforms like **Streamlit Cloud**.

---

## 🧰 Features

* Load student dataset directly from a CSV file hosted online.
* Preview dataset with rows, columns, and data types.
* Automatic preprocessing including:

  * Label encoding for categorical features.
  * Handling discrete numeric features.
* Train/Test split for model evaluation.
* Random Forest Classifier to predict student outcomes.
* Interactive Streamlit UI for testing individual student predictions:

  * Select categorical feature values.
  * Input numeric feature values.
* Visual feedback for prediction:

  * ❌ Dropout
  * ✅ Not Dropout
  * 🎉 Graduate
  * ➡️ Enrolled
* Accuracy score displayed after training.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is hosted online:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ASIF-Kh/Student-Dropout-Prediction/main/data.csv
```

**Columns:** All columns except `Target` are used as features.
`Target` column indicates student outcome (`Dropout`, `Graduate`, `Enrolled`).

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShindeOp/Student-Dropout-Prediction.git
cd Student-Dropout-Prediction
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Linux / Mac
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
```

3. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**requirements.txt** example:

```
streamlit
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
```

---

## 🚀 Running the App

Run the app locally using:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your default web browser. You can:

* Preview the dataset.
* Train the model (automatically on load).
* Make predictions for hypothetical students.

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Load Dataset**
   CSV dataset is loaded from a URL.

2. **Preprocessing**

   * Label encoding of categorical and discrete numeric features.
   * Target variable is label-encoded.

3. **Model Training**

   * Split data into training and testing sets (80:20).
   * Train **Random Forest Classifier**.

4. **Prediction UI**

   * User inputs student features.
   * Model predicts student outcome.
   * Displays dropout status and detailed prediction.

5. **Output**

   * Visual feedback with Streamlit components:

     * ✅ Success
     * ❌ Error
     * 🎉 Celebration (balloons)
     * ➡️ Info

## 🖼️ Screenshots

*(Optional: Add screenshots of the app here for better visibility)*

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

* Add **feature importance visualization**.
* Deploy on **Streamlit Cloud** or **Heroku**.
* Integrate **other ML models** like Logistic Regression or XGBoost.
* Handle **missing values** automatically.
* Add **historical prediction trends** visualization.
